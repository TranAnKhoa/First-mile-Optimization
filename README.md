## 📌 Overview

This project originates from a research collaboration between **International University (HCMIU)** and **CEL Consulting**.

The primary objective is to solve the **First Mile Logistics Optimization** problem—a critical and costly component of the supply chain involving the movement of goods from farms to factories. Beyond traditional optimization methods, this research proposes a novel **Hybrid Search Architecture** designed to enhance solution quality and convergence speed.

## 🧠 Methodology: The Hybrid Approach

This project implements an advanced variation of the **Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS)** metaheuristic.

The core innovation lies in the integration of Machine Learning techniques to guide the search process, specifically addressing the dynamic selection of heuristics:

### 🚀 Key Mechanism: RL & GP Guided Search
Instead of relying solely on standard adaptive weight adjustments, this framework utilizes a dual-intelligence layer:

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Acts as a high-level agent that learns from the search history to predict the most effective strategies for the current state.
* **Genetic Programming (GP):** Evolves and refines the decision-making logic over time.
* **Operator Selection:** Both RL and GP work in tandem to "guide" the ALNS algorithm, intelligently selecting the optimal pair of **Destroy** (remove customers) and **Repair** (re-insert customers) operators. This helps the algorithm escape local optima more efficiently than traditional random or roulette-wheel selection methods.
